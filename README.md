# which-college
College finder app - My first project during Class 12th for Computer Science subject.

A working python GUI that will get user's 12th cutoff, caste, etc. and display which colleges and courses are available. :)

MySQL is used.  Don't forget to change the password in both the myconn.py.

Run mysql_script.py to initialize the database and create tables.

Other admin's details should be added directly into the database.

Run ui/colgenie.py to use the application.

Data_4_tables contains the college names, course ids and course names with the opening cutoffs of the year 2019 in the TNEA counselling.

Images are in ui.
